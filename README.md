# Inspiration
As college students it is hard for us to plan out meals and always know what to cook. 
As a result, we spend a lot of time looking for recipes, deciding what to make, and looking through our fridge for items. 
This also causes us to having bad meals or missing whole meals. 

# What it does 
SnapFeast is an innovative application that can take a picture of your fridge and create recipes that you can make with the
ingredients inside your fridge. It gives out multiple recipes with prep time and cook time included so that you know
how long each recipe takes to make.
